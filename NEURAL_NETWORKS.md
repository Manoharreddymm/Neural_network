**Components of neural network:**

- **Neuron:** A small node called neuron contains 2 parts. They are summation of weights & inputs and activation function.
- **Weights and bias:** The bias allows the neuron to fit the data better and learn more complex patterns. The weights are assigned randomly at stating when the backpropagation is going on the weights are updated .
- **Activation function:** the activation function triggers the nodes when the input is higher than 0.5 other wise it remains block.

**Feed forward neural network:**
**
`	`A feedforward neural network (FNN) is a foundational type of artificial neural network in which information flows in a unidirectional manner,
 from input nodes through hidden layers (if present) to output nodes, without any feedback loops or cycles.
  It is composed of layers of interconnected neurons, where each neuron receives weighted inputs, applies an activation function,
   and passes the result to the next layer. The architecture typically includes three main types of layers: an input layer that receives raw data, one or more hidden layers where computations are performed to extract features and learn representations, 
   and an output layer that produces the final result. During training, the network uses a loss function to measure the difference between its predictions and actual values, adjusting the weights of connections via optimization algorithms like gradient descent.
  This process is guided by backpropagation, where gradients are computed and propagated backward to refine the model. Activation functions like ReLU, sigmoid, or tanh introduce non-linearities, enabling the network to model complex relationships. FNNs are versatile and widely used in applications such as image classification, natural language processing, and time-series forecasting,
 and they form the basis of more advanced architectures like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Despite their simplicity, they are limited by their inability to efficiently handle temporal data or spatial hierarchies, making them less suitable for some tasks compared to their successors.

**Deep neural network:** the deep neural network contains more number of hidden layers.

A deep neural network (DNN) is an advanced form of artificial neural network that distinguishes itself by having multiple layers of interconnected neurons, including an input layer, several hidden layers, and an output layer. 
These additional hidden layers allow the network to model and learn highly complex and hierarchical patterns from data, making DNNs particularly effective for tasks involving unstructured data such as images, text, and audio. 
Each neuron in the network processes inputs by computing a weighted sum and applying a non-linear activation function like ReLU, sigmoid, or tanh, enabling the model to learn non-linear relationships in the data. As the information flows from layer to layer, the network progressively extracts higher-level features, 
with earlier layers capturing basic patterns and deeper layers learning abstract representations. Training a DNN involves feeding labeled data into the network, calculating the error between predicted and true outputs using a loss function, and minimizing this error by adjusting the weights and biases of the neurons through optimization algorithms like gradient descent. 
This process is facilitated by backpropagation, where gradients are calculated and propagated backward through the network to update parameters efficiently.

DNNs have become the backbone of modern deep learning and are employed in a wide range of applications, from image classification, object detection, and speech recognition to natural language processing, recommendation systems, and game-playing agents. 
They are particularly effective in learning from large datasets, and their ability to generalize complex patterns has surpassed traditional machine learning models in many domains. For example, convolutional neural excel in processing visual data, while recurrent neural networks are designed for sequential data such as time series and text. 
Despite their power, DNNs require significant computational resources, extensive training data, and careful design of hyperparameters like learning rates, number of layers, and regularization techniques to avoid overfitting. Challenges such as vanishing or exploding gradients, high computational costs, and interpretability issues also arise in DNNs, but advancements in hardware and techniques like batch normalization, dropout, and transfer learning have addressed many of these limitations.

**Convolutional neural network:**

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a powerful type of deep learning model specifically designed for processing grid-structured data such as images, videos, and even certain time-series data. 
The key innovation of CNNs lies in their ability to automatically and efficiently learn spatial hierarchies of features through the use of convolutional layers. These layers apply filters (kernels) that slide across the input data, performing element-wise multiplications to extract features like edges, 
corners, textures, and shapes. Unlike traditional fully connected layers, convolutional layers preserve spatial relationships and reduce the number of parameters, making CNNs computationally efficient. Pooling layers, often following convolutional layers, 
further downsample the data by summarizing regions (e.g., using max pooling or average pooling), reducing the spatial dimensions while retaining the most critical information. This makes the network robust to minor translations, distortions, and noise in the input data. Non-linear activation functions like ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) are applied to introduce non-linearity, allowing the network to model complex patterns in the data.

CNN architectures often include multiple convolutional and pooling layers stacked together, followed by fully connected layers at the end to make predictions based on the extracted features. 
As the data flows through the layers, earlier layers learn basic features such as edges, while deeper layers capture more abstract and high-level features like shapes or objects. CNNs are trained using backpropagation and gradient descent to adjust the weights of filters and biases, minimizing the difference between predicted and actual outputs. 
Regularization techniques like dropout and batch normalization are commonly employed to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.

CNNs have revolutionized fields that rely on visual and spatial data. They are widely used in applications such as image classification (e.g., recognizing handwritten digits or identifying objects in photos), object detection, semantic segmentation, and even in non-visual tasks like speech recognition and natural language processing when spatial representations of data are utilized. Advanced CNN architectures like
 AlexNet, VGG, ResNet, and EfficientNet have pushed the boundaries of performance, often achieving human-level accuracy in complex tasks. Despite their efficiency, CNNs can be computationally demanding and require large amounts of labeled data for effective training. However, techniques like transfer learning and pre-trained models have made CNNs more accessible for a wide range of applications. Their ability to learn hierarchical features directly from raw data has made them a cornerstone of modern AI and deep learning.

**Recurrent neural network:**

A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a type of neural network designed for processing sequential data by capturing temporal dependencies and patterns. 
Unlike feedforward networks, RNNs have connections that form directed cycles, allowing information to persist across time steps. This recurrent nature enables RNNs to maintain a "memory" of previous inputs, making them well-suited for tasks where context or sequence matters, such as time-series forecasting, natural language processing, and speech recognition. 
Each RNN cell processes an input and passes its output as a hidden state to the next cell, along with the input at the next time step, creating a chain-like structure. The hidden states act as a summary of past information, enabling the model to analyze data over time.

However, traditional RNNs face challenges like vanishing or exploding gradients, which can make learning long-term dependencies difficult. To address these issues, advanced variants such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks were developed. 
These architectures introduce gating mechanisms to control the flow of information, effectively retaining relevant information over long sequences and discarding irrelevant data. RNNs are trained using backpropagation through time (BPTT), a variation of backpropagation that calculates gradients for sequential data.

RNNs have numerous applications, including language modeling, text generation, machine translation, sentiment analysis, speech-to-text systems, music composition, and even predicting stock prices.
 Despite their strengths, RNNs can be computationally intensive and slow to train due to their sequential nature. Advances like bidirectional RNNs, attention mechanisms, and Transformers have built upon the principles of RNNs, offering improved performance and efficiency in handling sequential data. 
 Nonetheless, RNNs remain foundational in understanding and processing data with inherent temporal structures.

**Long Short term memory:**

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a specialized type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) designed to address the limitations of traditional RNNs, particularly the vanishing gradient problem that hampers the learning of long-term dependencies in sequential data.
 An LSTM cell is composed of several gates—input, forget, and output gates—that regulate the flow of information. These gates use activation functions to decide what information to keep, update, or discard, enabling the network to retain relevant information over extended time steps and forget less useful data.
  Additionally, LSTMs maintain a cell state, a separate memory component that runs through the network with minimal modifications, ensuring the efficient preservation of long-term dependencies.

The input gate determines what new information to add to the cell state, the forget gate decides what information to erase, and the output gate controls the information passed to the next hidden state. 
This gating mechanism allows LSTMs to learn both short-term and long-term patterns effectively. LSTMs are trained using backpropagation through time (BPTT) to minimize errors by adjusting the weights of gates and connections.

LSTMs excel in tasks requiring sequential understanding, such as natural language processing (e.g., language modeling, text generation, and machine translation), speech recognition, time-series forecasting, and video analysis.
 For example, in language translation, LSTMs can capture contextual relationships between words across a sentence, even if they are far apart. Despite their strengths, LSTMs can be computationally intensive due to their complex architecture and are being increasingly complemented or replaced by newer models like Transformers, which offer better scalability for large datasets.
  However, LSTMs remain a robust choice for many applications requiring sequential data processing and memory retention.
